#### TO DO LIST

1) sort out folder structure
2) have initial run using randomGLM package
3) test run glmnet and understand hyper-parameter tuning 
4) investigate if randomGLM package can be changed to utilise glmnet
5) ELSE: building features:
  - bootstrapping
  - nfeatures in bag
  - parallelise glm fitting
  - cross validation of glm (internal or single run)
  - aggregation process
  - feature ranking
  - extracting linear predictors
  - thinning?

6) compress entire process into a library
  
6) R&D:
  - how can we implement splines?
